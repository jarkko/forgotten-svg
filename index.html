          <h3>What if there was a graphics format that…</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>…scaled to <em>whichever size and pixel density</em> you wanted?</li>
            <li>…was <em>small in size</em>?</li>
            <li>…had its own DOM and was thus fully <em>scriptable with Javascript</em> and <em>style-able with CSS</em>?</li>
            <li>…<em>let you</em> debug itself with the plain old <em>“view source”</em> and <em>“inspect element”</em>?</li>
            <li>…<em>worked natively</em> in virtually <em>every modern browser</em>?</li>

          <ul>
            <li>…having your name under a site whose graphics look like shit on a Retina screen?</li>
            <li>…generating 2x versions of your graphics that are really just bitmapped versions of vector images?</li>
            <li>…serving graphs as static images when you'd really want to give your users something more interactive?</li>

          <h3>Meet SVG</h3>

          <p>SVG comes from <em><strong>Scalable Vector Graphics</strong></em>. Back in the day, people came up with names that actually described what they stood for.</p>
          
          <p>Just like its name implies, <strong>SVG scales infinitely</strong> because it's vector-based. But the goodies don't end there. It's <strong>XML-based</strong> so it has its own <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> that's fully understood and exposed by modern browsers. You can thus style SVG graphics with CSS and modify and animate them using Javascript.</p>
          
          <p>SVG powers behind the scenes many awesome graphics libraries such as <a href="http://raphaeljs.com">Raphaël.js</a> and <a href="http://d3js.org">D3.js</a>. It's supported by all major modern browsers and more than a billion devices worldwide. And yet it itself is mostly forgotten.</p>
          
          <p>Most books about SVG are a decade old. Most online tutorials showing up in Google results either don't work, are not that educational, look like crap, or all of the above.</p>
          
          <p>
            <strong><em>SVG deserves better. And so do you.</em></strong>

              <li>
                …help you learn to build your own swatch of icons that literally go to eleven.
              </li>
              <li>…teach you how to manipulate and animate your graphics using native SVG means and Javascript.</li>
              <li>…provide you with an interactive learning playground inspired by the ideas of <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/">Bret Victor</a></li>
